# Pre-Commit

Used for managing Git hooks. Must be installed globally on the respective
system. As it is written in Python, for example
[`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) can be used to install it.

- [pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com)
- [github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)

Whenever this repository is initially cloned, the following should be executed:

```shell
pre-commit install --install-hooks
pre-commit install --install-hooks --hook-type commit-msg
```

Pre-commit should now run on every commit.

It is configured via [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](../.pre-commit-config.yaml).

## GitHub Integration

While pre-commit is used in GitHub Actions, there is no explicit job or workflow
where pre-commit is executed. This happens through the continuous integration
service [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci/) and the related GitHub App
[pre-commit ci](https://github.com/marketplace/pre-commit-ci).

Configuration for this is done in the repository owner's settings and the
[pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci/) web user interface.

## Housekeeping

### Update hooks

```shell
pre-commit autoupdate
```

## Cheat Sheet
